# CCNA_Project

Hello! I've just completed an uncomplicated project focused on hotel management across three floors, each hosting a variety of departments. Here's a breakdown of the tools I employed for this project:
1/ VLAN: Manage network traffic using multi-partition VLANs.
2/ Sub-interfaces: Divide the network seamlessly to achieve efficient management communication.
3/ DHCP: Automate IP assignment to devices.
4/ DNS: Enable easy-to-use web addressing.
5/ OSPF Routing: Optimize data routing with OSPF for the entire network.
6/ SSH: Ensure secure remote management through the SSH protocol.
7/ Port Security: Enhancing cyber security through physical access control.
